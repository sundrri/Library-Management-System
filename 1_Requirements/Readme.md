# Requirements
## Introduction
•	Searching for a book in a real large library is a very tedious process and keeping manual method of tracking book transactions is even more tedious. So through this program I have come up with a solution which can ease these tasks by implementing a “C program” using the linked lists Data Structures. This program is able to keep track of the book transactions in the library. We begin with adding books of different genre to the corresponding genre. In this program we as a user can perform adding, borrowing and returning of the books and more importantly displaying the information of the books in the library.

•	The library management is a project that manages and stores books information electronically according to students needs. The system helps both students and library manager to keep a constant track of all the books available in the library. It allows both the admin and the student to search for the desired book.

## Research
•	The number of students studying in a school or a university are much more than one can think of keeping a track of records for the students. Most of the Library Management system consists of operations such as searching the books, displaying the information of books. 

•	This project involves signing in of the user and has account for each user where his/her books and various operation options can be displayed. Each book will have a unique identification number, also known as access number and other details including title, author and availability in library which will help to know about the book. There could be more than one copy of a book and each copy is assigned a unique access number.

## Benefits
1.	Simple & Easy to Use
2.	Increased Library Engagement
3.	Efficient Cloud Data Management
4.	Highly Secure, Scalable & Reliable
5.	Mobile Access
6.	Dynamic Reports
7.	Fully Customizable
8.	Cost-effective
9.	Less burden on staff
10.	Reducing wastage of paper
11.	Time Saving

## Cost and Features with Time
In order to determine the cost to develop library management system, a few aspects are to be considered first:

•	Size of the App: More the features, more the cost.

•	Number of Platforms: As the number of platforms are increased cost will also be increased significantly.

•	If Indian App firm is chosen to create a Library Management System then the cost can range between $25000-$35000. This estimate is when the system is being developed with basic features and for a single platform.


## Defining Our System

Library Management System is where the manager(The Librarian) can login to system by providing username and password, add books by providing details like Book ID, Book name, Author's Name, Student who Issued, Date Issued, Return date delete book by providing book id, search book by its name, display/view all books and update username and password.
Library Checkout holds some of the very basic features of a library management system:
•	Create a record
•	Delete a record
•	Search a book
•	Display record
The whole system is operated by an admin
